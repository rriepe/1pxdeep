#### JBST 1pxdeep Theme
[JBST](http://www.jbst.eu/) is a powerful theme framework that can be used as a standalone website builder or as a framework to create child themes for WordPress build on Twitter's Bootstrap 3. Full customizable with [LESS](http://www.lesscss.org/). Relative color design is designing by relative visual weight, or designing with color schemes. [1pxdeep](http://rriepe.github.io/1pxdeep/) brings that concept to Bootstrap and this the [JBST 1pxdeep Theme](https://github.com/bassjobsen/jbst-1pxdeep-theme) brings it to WordPress.
